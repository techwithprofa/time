RUN npm install

# If you are using a private npm registry, you might need to configure .npmrc here
# COPY .npmrc .npmrc
# RUN npm ci
# RUN rm -f .npmrc

# Bundle app source
COPY bacend/. .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE ${API_PORT:-3000} 
# The ${API_PORT:-3000} syntax means it will use the API_PORT from the .env file at build time if available, 
# or default to 3000 if not set. However, for runtime port exposure, this is more illustrative.
# The actual port mapping will be handled in docker-compose.yml.

# Define the command to run the application
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
